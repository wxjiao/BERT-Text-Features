We can use locally saved pre-trained BERT models.

Take the `bert-base-uncased` model as an example, we should rename the files as below:
- `bert-base-uncased-config.json` --> `bert_config.json`
- `bert-base-uncased-pytorch_model.bin` --> `pytorch_model.bin`
- `bert-base-uncased-vocab.txt` --> `vocab.txt`
